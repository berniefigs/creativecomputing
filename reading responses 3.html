        <p><strong>How does changing the typography of an iconic logotype such as Google, affect the way people think of the company, especially when drastic changes are being made?</strong></p>
    <br><br>

        <p>Google decided to rebrand their logo that was created in 1999 and changing it serif to sans-serif. The letterforms are geometric and modern. Google is expanding and experiementing amongst their other ventures within Google X, Alphabet, Calico, Youtube, and so many more. Not only is Google accessible on a computer screen but also the palm of your hands. They didn't change the logo because people were getting tired of it, but it was evident that Google was becoming bigger than ever, and they needed their brand to represent them accurately as possible. Intially, people were a bit outraged, which is always expected when change occurs. But I think overall the reactions were all over the place, from joy to disgust. Google's new logo wanted to convey passion, friendliness, and a humanly aspect.
