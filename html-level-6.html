    <h1>Have You Ever</h1> <br>
    <p>had so <h1>much</h1> to say  <br>
    that your mouth closed up tight,  <br>
    struggling to harness the nuclear force  <br>
    coalescing within your words?  <br>
  <br>
    Have you ever  <br>
    had <h1>so many</h1> thoughts  <br> 
    churning inside that you didn't <br> 
    dare let them escape, <br>
    in case they blew you <h1>wide open?</h1> <br>
 <br>
    <h1>Have you ever</h1>  <br>
    been so angry that you  <br>
    couldn't look in the mirror  <br>
    for <h1>fear</h1> of finding the face of <h1>evil</h1>  <br>
    glaring back at <h1>you?</h1></p>
