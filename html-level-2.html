    Have You Ever / had so much to say  / that your mouth closed up tight, / struggling to harness the nuclear force / 
    coalescing within your words? / Have you ever / had so many thoughts / churning inside that you didn't / dare let them escape, /  in case they blew you wide open? / Have you ever / been so angry that you / couldn't look in the mirror / for fear of finding the face of evil  / glaring back at you?
