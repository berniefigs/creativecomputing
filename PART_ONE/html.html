<h1>Assignment 4 Part 1</h1>
<p>For the Map a Journey Assignment I chose the route from my house to the Museum of Modern Art. The journey on the map kind of resembles somewhat of a backwards “L”. I chose this journey because every week or so, I like to go to museums and check out new art exhibits, especially modern and contemporary art. It really inspires me to go every weekend and provokes me to create more art, a never ending spiral of creativity. During the week, I am jam-packed with assignments from a full time schedule as a student and working part-time. The weekends are utterly therapeutic, it is so important to me and my mental health that I stay busy and unwind. Usually on the way to the museum I always get so excited, accompanied with a dirty chai latte in one hand. So the journey begins as I leave my place on 92nd Street Upper East Side. I walk a couple blocks to the subway station and take the 4 or 5 train Downtown which takes roughly 25 minutes. Since it is the weekend the train is usually full, but it always depends on what time it is. In the morning it is not so crowded, but lately in the day is when it starts to get packed. Then I get off at Lexington Ave/59th Street and walk the rest of the way. I enjoy walking so I don’t mind walking the rest of the way instead of transferring to another train. I pass through Madison Ave, and pass all these luxurious shops: Saks 5th, Burberry, Louis Vuitton. Then can not miss the Trump Tower, I scowl every time I pass it. It’s near the Rockefeller Center so sometimes it’s nice to just take a loop around. Then In front of the Radio City Music Hall is that huge KAWS sculpture, which I never get tired of seeing. Then viola, I finally reach the Museum of Modern Art. It’s in a great location where it is so lively, which I love. Sometimes there’s food markets and people have their own tents selling their goods and it’s a good vibe. Since there are so many attractions there it is always lively. But once I hit the museum it is bliss because it is just me and the art. Regarding the visual material, it depends on the season really. It’s starting to get cooler, so I always feel the rush of cold air hitting me. I always am equipped with my Beats By Dre headphones that are so good at tuning out noise, so on my commute I am constantly jamming out. But in the background noise I hear engines of cars, distant conversations, and music blasting from Halal food trucks. Then there are so many restaurants that sound so delicious. There’s plenty of food trucks posted up on the side of the roads. If you walk a couple blocks north, around W 57th Street, there is Central Park. It is such a great location with never ending things todo and encounter. </p>
