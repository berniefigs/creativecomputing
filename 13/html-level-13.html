    <em>Have You Ever <br>
    <p>had so much to say  <br>
    that your mouth closed up tight,  <br>
    struggling to harness the nuclear force  <br>
    coalescing within your words? </p> <br>
  <br>
    Have you ever  <br>
    had so many thoughts  <br> 
    churning inside that you didn't <br> 
    dare let them escape, <br>
    in case they blew you wide open? <br>
 <br>
    Have you ever  <br>
    been so angry that you  <br>
    couldn't look in the mirror  <br>
    for fear of finding the face of evil  <br>
    glaring back at you?</em>
