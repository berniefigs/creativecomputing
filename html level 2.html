    <h1>Have You Ever</h1> <br>

    <p>had so much to say  <br>
    that your mouth <h6>closed up tight</h6>,  <br>
    struggling to <strong>harness</strong> the nuclear force  <br>
    coalescing within your words?  <br>
  <br>
    <h4>Have you ever</h4>  <br>
    had so <h3>many thoughts</h3>  <br> 
    churning inside that you didn't <br> 
    dare let them escape, <br>
    in case they blew you <h2>wide</h2> open? <br>
 <br>
    Have you ever  <br>
    been <h2>so angry</h2> that you  <br>
    couldn't <em>look in the mirror</em>  <br>
    for fear of finding the face of evil  <br>
    glaring back at you?</p>
