    <strong>Have You Ever </strong><br> <br>
    <p><em>had so much to say</em>  <br> <br>
    <strong>that your mouth closed up tight, </strong> <br><br>
    <em>struggling to harness the nuclear force </em> <br><br>
    <strong>coalescing within your words? </strong> <br>
  <br>
    <em>Have you ever</em>  <br><br>
    <strong>had so many thoughts </strong> <br> <br>
    <em>churning inside that you didn't </em><br> <br>
    <strong>dare let them escape, </strong><br><br>
   <em> in case they blew you wide open?</em> <br><br>
 <br>
   <strong> Have you ever </strong> <br><br>
    <em>been so angry that you</em>  <br><br>
   <strong> couldn't look in the mirror </strong> <br><br>
    <em>for fear of finding the face of evil </em> <br><br>
    <strong>glaring back at you?</strong></p>
