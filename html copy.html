        I think in uprising of social media and advances in the Web has sprung this idea of being transparent on and off social media. People nowadays are perfecting the art of being authentic on and off social media platforms. With the advances of social media it has made it incredibly easy for people showcase their identity or passions via the Web. Most social media influencers have Twitters, Instagram, Youtube vlogs, Snapchats, and etc. to showcase their content. Personally to me, it feels like a one sided relationship, treating them like celebrity. I think the cause of all this is that ironically people tend to lose authenticity because people are trying so hard to be liked and so they conform to the trends or what is “hot” to gather the right attention. There is also a constant pressure of always outdoing your last post, getting your feed right, or posting it at the right time. Petty problems, but social media has given many people who never expected to have a huge platform one and able to showcase their passion or hobbies to the whole world with one click. I think with the advances of design and technology within the Web and web design, the user is able to create their own personal taste through their layouts and websites, which is always nice to get a sense of the person.</p>
